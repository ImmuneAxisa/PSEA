Description: PSEA takes in a ranked list of peaks, 
  e.g. from differential abundance analysis, 
  and calculated enrichment scores for other peak-set. 
  To do so, it first annotates peaks from the primary dataset 
  by overlap with public peak-sets from databases. 
  It then uses GSEA for rank-based enrichment analyses.
